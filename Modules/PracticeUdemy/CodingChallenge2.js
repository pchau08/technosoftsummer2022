// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
// calculated using the formula:
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
// and height in meter).
// Your tasks:
// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
// versions)
// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
// whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
// Test data:
// § Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
// m tall.
// § Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m 

const massMark = 95;
const heighttMark = 1.88
const massJohn = 85;
const heightJohn = 1.76;

const BMIMark = massMark / heighttMark ** 2;
const BMIJohn = massJohn / (heightJohn * heightJohn);
const markHigherBMI = BMIMark > BMIJohn;

console.log(BMIMark, BMIJohn, markHigherBMI);

// Coding Challenge #2
// Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and
// improve it.
// Your tasks:
// 1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message
// is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
// 2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
// BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
// Hint: Use an if/else statement �
// GOOD LUCK 

if(BMIMark > BMIJohn) {
    console.log(`Marks BMI ${BMIMark} has a higher BMI ${BMIJohn} than John`);
} else {
    console.log(`Johns BMI ${BMIJohn} has a higher BMI ${BMIMark} than Mark`);
}
