// Coding Challenge #4
// Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a
// restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and
// 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.
// Your tasks:
// 1. Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for
// this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement � (If it's easier for you, you can
// start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary
// operator!)
// 2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value
// (bill + tip). Example: “The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value
// 316.25”
// Test data:
// § Data 1: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430
// Hints:
// § To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
// § Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300 �
// GOOD LUCK 


const bill = 275;
const tip = bill <= 300 && bill >= 50 ? bill * 0.20 : bill * 0.2;
console.log(`The bill was ${bill}, the tip was ${tip}, and the total value was ${bill + tip}`);


let temp = 35;

if (temp >= 65) {
    console.log("Turn AC on");
} else if (temp <= 50) {
    console.log("Turn HEAT on");
}
